# Concept:
Our target is to make maths easier in python with various mfunctions that you need not to code wasting your  time.

# Maths Branches till now:
- Number theory
- Linear Algebra
- switch data types

We will include more maths braches later. Stay connected.

# How to use:
Just download the .zip file of our project and unzip in your python environment and use it by just:

```python
import Atrmaths
```
- To use Number theory library use:
```python
import Atrmaths.numbertheory
```
  See number theory library documentation [here](https://github.com/atrajit-sarkar/Atrmaths/blob/main/Numbertheory.md#below-is-the-full-documentation-of-the-numbertheory-library)
- To use Linear Algebra library:
```python
import Atrmaths.linear_alg 
```
- To use switch data type library:
```python
import Atrmaths.switch
```
