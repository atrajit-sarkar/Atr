# Below is the full documentation of the numbertheory library:

## Finding gcd of two numbers:
```python
import Atrmaths.numbertheory as nt
num1,num2=input("Enter numbers: ").split(",")
print(nt.gcd(int(num1),int(num2)))
```
## Finding gcd of multiple numbers given as arguments:

```python
import Atrmaths.numbertheory as nt
print(nt.Gcd(2,5,7,8,9))
```
